A File Format API is a software interface that allows developers to access, manipulate, and modify different file formats. These APIs can read and write data in a wide range of formats, such as Microsoft Office formats (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), PDF, HTML, EPUB, and more. File format APIs provide an easy and efficient way to automate document-related tasks, such as merging, splitting, converting, and watermarking.

## Why Do You Need a File Format API?

In today's fast-paced business world, time is money. Every organization strives to automate its processes and save time wherever possible. File format APIs help businesses achieve this goal by automating document-related tasks. With a file format API, you can quickly convert files from one format to another, extract data from documents, merge documents, and perform other tasks without manual intervention. This saves time and ensures accuracy, as there is less room for human error.

## Choosing the Right File Format API
