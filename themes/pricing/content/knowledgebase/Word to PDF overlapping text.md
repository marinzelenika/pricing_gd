There are several reasons why Word to PDF conversion can result in text overlap. Let's take a closer look.

## Why Does Text Overlap When Converting Word to PDF?
One of the main reasons why text overlap occurs is due to differences in how Word and PDF files handle page layout and font sizes. Word documents may look great on your computer screen, but when you convert them to PDF, the layout can shift, causing text to overlap.

Here are some key differences between Word and PDF page layouts and font sizes:

Page Layout:

Word: In Microsoft Word, the page layout is dynamic and can change based on the content and formatting settings. Word documents are typically created with an adjustable page size, such as letter or A4, and the content flows dynamically as you add or remove text. Word allows you to set margins, adjust spacing, and use features like headers, footers, and columns to customize the layout.
PDF: Portable Document Format (PDF) is designed to preserve the visual appearance of a document across different devices and platforms. PDF files have fixed page layouts, meaning the content appears exactly as intended, regardless of the device or software used to open them. The page size, margins, and other layout settings are typically defined during the creation of the PDF and remain unchanged.

Font Sizes:

Word: In Word, you can adjust the font size freely, specifying the size in points (e.g., 12pt, 14pt, etc.). Word provides a wide range of font sizes, allowing precise control over the appearance of text. You can also modify the font size of specific sections, headings, or paragraphs independently.
PDF: Similarly to Word, PDF files can include various font sizes. However, PDFs are typically created by converting existing documents or through specialized software, where the font sizes are specified beforehand. When viewing a PDF, you can zoom in or out to adjust the on-screen display, but the actual font size remains fixed unless the document includes embedded fonts that allow for text reflow.

It's important to note that while Word provides more flexibility for editing and adjusting layouts, PDFs are generally used for sharing documents in a format that preserves the intended appearance and prevents accidental modifications.

Another reason for text overlap is when the Word document has complex formatting, such as multiple columns, tables, and images. These formatting elements can be challenging to convert accurately, resulting in text overlap.
The good news is that there is a solution to this problem.

## How to Fix Overlapping Text in Word?
If you are experiencing text overlap in your Word document, you can use the following tips to fix the issue:
1. Adjust the margins: Sometimes, adjusting the margins can help fix text overlap issues. You can do this by going to "Page Layout" > "Margins" and selecting a different margin size.
2. Use columns: If you have a lot of text, consider using columns instead of a single column. You can do this by going to "Page Layout" > "Columns."
3. Use tables: Tables can be an effective way to organize text and prevent overlap. You can insert a table by going to "Insert" > "Table."
4. Check font sizes: Ensure that you are using consistent font sizes throughout your document. You can do this by selecting all text and going to "Home" > "Font" and selecting a font size.

## Tips to Get Rid of Text Overlapping in Word
To prevent text overlap issues in your Word documents, you can use the following tips:
1. Use consistent formatting: Ensure that you are using consistent formatting throughout your document. This includes font sizes, margins, and spacing.
2. Use styles: Styles can be an effective way to ensure consistent formatting throughout your document. You can create a style by selecting text and going to "Home" > "Styles."
3. Avoid complex formatting: Complex formatting, such as multiple columns and images, can be challenging to convert to PDF accurately. Consider simplifying your document's formatting to prevent text overlap issues.
4. Use Aspose.Words API: Aspose.Words API can be an effective solution to prevent text overlap issues when converting Word documents to PDF. It uses advanced algorithms to ensure accurate conversion and handles complex formatting elements.
5. Preview before converting: Before converting your Word document to PDF, preview the document to ensure that there are no text overlap issues. You can do this by going to "File" > "Print Preview."
By following these tips, you can prevent text overlap issues in your Word documents and ensure accurate conversion to PDF.

Here's an example of how to use Aspose to convert a Word document to a PDF:

```C
	// Load the Word document
	Document doc = new Document("input.docx");

	// Create a new instance of PdfSaveOptions
	PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions();

	// Set the page size to A4
	options.PageSetup.PageHeight = PageSize.A4.Height;
	options.PageSetup.PageWidth = PageSize.A4.Width;

	// Set the margins to 1 inch
	options.PageSetup.LeftMargin = 72;
	options.PageSetup.RightMargin = 72;
	options.PageSetup.TopMargin = 72;
	options.PageSetup.BottomMargin = 72;

	// Embed all fonts used in the document
	options.EmbedFullFonts = true;

	// Save the document as PDF
	doc.Save("output.pdf", options);
```
